## 🛠️ Build Instructions

> **Note:** This repo uses submodules. Make sure to clone it **recursively**.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/CloudCodingSpace/MeltedForge.git
```

The make change the directory into the repo's remote folder/directory. Then create a folder/directory
like bin/out/build for the binary output. Then run the following commands :- 

```bash
cmake -S . -B <path-to-build-dir>
cmake --build <path-to-build-dir> --parallel
```

> **Note:** Before running the executable of the MFTest, make sure that the shaders are compiled. Helper scripts to compile shaders on Window are in the scripts folder.
